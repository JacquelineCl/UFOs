# UFOs
module 11
## Overview
This project was completed to make searching through reported UFO sightings easier by making the information easier to access. 

## Results
The ability to view the webpage on multiple device types. Plus, the ability to filter the ufo sightings by date, city, state, country, and/or shape. Examples of expected formatting can be found in each search box when the page first loads. 

In order to get to the information you're looking for:
1. Click on the appropriate input box and enter a specific date/city/state/country/shape
2. Click enter
3. The table on the right will update based upon the information entered
4. Enter additional search criteria in another input box to further refine the results if desired

If you don't receive the expected results, verify the formatting of the inforamtion matches the image below:

## Summary
This webpage does simplify searching through the information provided much easier, however it only provieds information from January 2010. One area of opportunity is to include more sightings. 

Further development could include:
* adding a way to easily clear the filters
* adding the ability to easily export the table
* automatically updating the information if a reliable source is found
